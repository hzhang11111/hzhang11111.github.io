    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Installation Waste Not by Song Dong offers me a fresh way of perceiving memories. He displays over 10,000 items from his mother’s decades-long collection. The artifacts serve as a means of remembering. It revisits the memories of a specific family living in a politically unstable era. The work elicits strong emotions via the rediscovery of intimated objects Song Dong’s mother collected, all of which retain memories.</p><p>Personal objects from Song Dong’s installation not only preserve memory but also feelings and experiences at the time. This rekindling of past experiences and emotions reminds me of this creative repository we are building now. By writing down and organizing the things we see and learn each day in life or class, we can always go back and look at what inspires us and  influences our art-making process.</p><p>My work is always related to memory. I explore the theme in my writing, my photographs, and my video work.  Different means of approaches reveal the topic differently. From my perspective, memory is an abstract and floating mind, which can’t be truly stored the way it was. But Song Dong’s installation transforms this abstraction into specific objects. It inspires me to think memory’s  characteristic as an attachment to certain objects.</p>]]></content>
